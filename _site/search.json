Most of my success comes from my amazing wife, Bayaraa, and our son.\nOver the years I’ve done a lot of different things. What I have learned is that I love technology and I enjoy building things. I’ve failed at many things, but I keep learning and keep going.\nI write semi regularly on this site, and I welcome email."
