I'm a data scientist, professor, and business creator based in Mongolia. Most of my success comes from my amazing wife, Bayaraa, and our son.

Over the years I've done a lot of different things. What I have learned is that I love technology and I enjoy building things. I've failed at many things, but I keep learning and keep going.

I write semi regularly on this site, and I welcome <a href="mailto:robertritz@outlook.com" class="text-blue-500 underline">email</a>.
